|IDE|	Visual Studio Code |	PyCharm
|Operating System	|Linux|	Windows|
|Version-control platform|	GitHub|	GitLab|


## VS code 
Visual Studio Code is a free coding tool that makes it easy to get started coding. It allows you to code in any programming language without having to switch editors. Many languages are supported by Visual Studio Code, including Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and many others.
Its purpose is to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle.



## Pycharm
PyCharm has various tools to assist you detect issues and fix them. Because it contains so many Python-oriented features, PyCharm is undoubtedly the greatest IDE for Python projects so ita the best in python. PyCharm, on the other hand, offers smart code completion, code inspections, on-the-fly error flagging and quick-fixes, as well as automated code refactorings and rich navigation.

## Comparing
When compared to PyCharm, Microsoft's Visual Studio Code is substantially faster. When compared to PyCharm, it is extremely light. Visual Studio Code is the clear winner when it comes to a modular approach to wiring code. also VS code offers a large number of extensions, add-ons, and other libraries.


## Linux
The most well-known and widely used open source operating system is Linux. Linux is an operating system that sits on top of all other software on a computer, receiving requests from other applications and transmitting those requests to the computer's hardware.

## Windows
Microsoft created the Windows operating system. A computer's operating system is what allows you to use it. Most new personal computers (PCs) come with Windows preinstalled, making it the world's most popular operating system. In the mid-1980s, Microsoft released the initial version of Windows.

## Comparing

+ linux is an open source and its free not like windows
+ linux is muxh lighter than windows
+ linux have more security than windows 
+ linux have more hiden fetures
+ windows is more easy to use than linux
+ windows is more populer

## githup
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.


## gitlab
Gitlab is a service that allows you to access Git repositories from anywhere. The services offer extra capabilities to help manage the software development lifecycle in addition to hosting your code.

## comparing
The platform each ideology presents is the main distinction between GitHub and GitLab. GitLab is more focused on giving a features-based system with a centralized, integrated platform for web developers, whereas GitHub offers superior availability and is more focused on infrastructure performance.

## chosen tools 

in my project i choose windows as an os but i used ubuntu termenal on it and the reasons are becuse ubuntu gives me more features than windows and all i needed from it was the terminal and i have windows because its more easy to use.

for the IDE i used VS code and this tool is the best for programing because its offer a lot of progaming languages and give us a easy steps for debugging and see the steps to solve errors.

also i used githup because GitHub is a website where programmers and developers may collaborate on code. The main advantage of GitHub is its version control system, which enables seamless collaboration without jeopardizing the original project's integrity. Open-source software can be found in the projects on GitHub.


# 3:
+ in my project i needed to work in team and as a team we should work together so we used github because it let us work together and merge our work with each other in an easy way 

+ for the vs code i used it because i needed to work on html and css and js and the vs code provide me all these three and it give me a live server that let me see my code running and let me test it without hard steps and in clear way so it was the best choice also its linked with the git hub with the ubuntu tirmenal so i can pull the work and push it and do whatever i need in a simple steps

+ i used ubuntu tirmenal for many reasons first of it because the ubuntu give us more access and more commands and features than any other os also its connect the vs code and github together to make the work easier on us and the ubuntu is so secure comparing to any other OS.
